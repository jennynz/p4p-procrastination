Mashing dem keys
Bashing around trying things. Can now extract distances from lips in data frames
Demographic plots of mean area functions
Mean area functions
Fixed read story data now that there are more csvs starting with the same SXX format
Story resonance and formant plots
Lots of r1/r2 plots
Unnormalised correlations
Modify interspeaker correlations for one region only to take functinos
PCA on AmE data
Backup of project report
Forgot to load emuR for bark scaling
Fixed resonances bug and removed unnecessary PCA on resonances sections
Inter-speaker Correlations between resonances
Plot R1/R2 for NZE and AmE separately
R1/R2 plots looking goooood!
Fixed bug in skipping nearby peaks
Ignore indices which are too close in spectrum peaks
Frequency bins sussed
Fixed bug in reading NZE
VT lengths function
Reading Story data can now be interpolated to n values
Resonance functions from Catherinegit status
Updated pca_1Set_combined.R to be compatible with function version of readAreaFunctions, and turned off default smoothing
Adding options for normalisation etc. to interspeaker correlations
Finally actually removing the area functions so git doesn't take so long each time
AmE data correlations and variances
Removing All VT data because it's too big
Adding all the distance_area text files
Trying to modify gitignore to include distance_area files
Start combining AmE and NZE data sets for interspeaker correlations
AmE inter-speaker correlations done
Reading in Story data complete
Story data scraped
Quantifying variability variance and correlations
Reading 2 repetitions of area functions for VT04
Bar plots for indiviual variance analysis
Individual variance analysis
Update project log
More descriptive combined PCA plots
Nicer plot of comparing interpolated area functions
Analyse correlations between cavities separately
plotAreaFunctions.R optimised with loops, eliminated repetition
Inter-speaker correlations for just pharyngeal region
Update project log
Try rotating VT02 australian data to fit centroids of NZE
Use eplot bark scaling to achieve nice vowel plots
Tidy up csv files
Add project log
Exclude VT02 to see effect on variance
VT02 Comparison completed with errors in plotting
VT02 comparison plotted
Make a start on script for VT02 comparison
